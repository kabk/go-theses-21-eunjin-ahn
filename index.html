        I loved horror movies since I was a kid. But from a certain point, it was so disturbing to watch horror films so I stopped and it took a long time to be able to watch them again. In horror movies mostly women are hit, raped and killed
        or they are just a monster. Is it possible to be a feminist and horror film fan at the same time?

        <br>
        <br>Over time, the way of illustrating female characters in horror movies is quite different from the past. In this thesis, I classified the way women are consumed in horror movies into four categories. Each chapter will provide direct
        examples through specific films for each type, and I will observe the comparison the way female characters are portrayed in past horror films versus the way female characters are portrayed in modern horror films. I will analyze the gaze
        we look at horror movies and create an opportunity to think about new directions for horror movies to move forward. Furthermore, I would like to ask what attitude and responsibility we should have as artists through this research.

            It takes a lot of excuses to explain why you love horror movies. Since <i>L'arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat</i>(1896), many genres have been
            created in the history of movies, and various films have been created, but there is no genre regarded as the lowest echelon of movie society as horror. There is a widespread atmosphere that horror movies are terrible and
            stimulating, and only people who have serious mental problems like horror movies. But horror has always been around us and we are instinctively fascinated by
            horror.<br>
            <blockquote><i>‚ÄúSo he spoke, and Lycaon‚Äôs heart failed him, his knees likewise, and letting go the spear he sank to the ground his arms outstretched. But Achilles, drawing his keen sword, struck him on the neck and collarbone, the
                double-edged blade biting through, so he fell headlong in the dust, and the black blood ran out and soaked the earth.‚Äù</i></blockquote>
            This cruel murder scene is a part of the classic The Iliad. Like Hendrick Goltzius‚Äô <i>The dragon devouring the companions of Cadmus</i>(1588), which depicts the image of the dragon chewing the head of a person, all kinds of visual
            images of Jesus' hardships and the brutal accomplishments of mythical heroes repeated in historical paintings, sculptures and literature.

            <br><br>
            Horror is a genre that is not awkward for women to take up all the posters. Usually in horror films, female character‚Äôs time of appearance in the film is more than half of the screening time. It is hard to find a genre where women
            are as lead rolls as this. Google analyzed 100 films and found out horror genre is the only genre that female character‚Äôs time of appearance in the film is more than half of the screening time. February 24, 2017, Google, along with
            the Gina Davis Foundation, used machine learning to analyze the top 100 films in the box office among the films released in the United States for three years from 2014 to 2016, and released a survey of the degree of gender equality
            in movies. The analysis showed that the average time of women's appearance in all genres except horror movies was less than half of the screening time. Therefore, it is not awkward to say that horror film is the most female-driven
            movie. But ironically, behind them, there is a long-standing misogyny. Those who scream, be anxious and become subject to violence are female characters. The existence that feels fear and anxiety in the movie and makes the audience
            feel fear is usually a women or a woman-like creature and they cause fear and disgust, sometimes twisted pleasure, to the audience who watches horror movies. In particular, they are described as isolated people from the outside,
            people with little place to rely on, or as people who are treated as geeks. There are also horror films in which both female and male characters are the main characters. In a film in which non-individual groups are the main
            characters, female characters and male characters are mixed but they are bound by a certain sexual relationship. The film depicts their sexual relationship, sexualizing the body of a female character and leading the audience to
            consume it sexually. Unnecessary sexual scenes or shower scenes are the good examples. The way female characters are depicted in horror films is not much different from the way women are fetishized in pornography. Sex and horror are
            inseparable relationships, especially in pornographic horrors and slasher subgenres.<br>

            <br>
            By looking at depictions of women through the lens of horror movie history, we can recognize the power of representation and how it interacts with society. The portrayal of women in horror movies is not much different from the way
            people treat women in real society. It can be said that it is the social structure of reality. There are certainly some people who compare female characters in old literature and old TV shows, saying how much better women‚Äôs social
            status is better than before thanks to the feminist movement. Or some can talk about the Ripley of <i>Alien</i>(1979) and talk about how she was a revolutionary and wonderful horror heroine character. Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of
            Ellen Ripley was groundbreaking in 1979 but they do not know that even such Ripley has limitations. But over time, as we come to modern times, there are more and more female characters in various horror movies that have evolved. The
            world and the world of horror movies are slowly but surely improving. Therefore, I think there should be more criticism and theory of feminist gaze toward horror movies which is female characters make up more than half of screen
            time. The link between film and politics is not easy to see at first sight, but like other artworks, the film is a political medium. Films have been used to tell stories vividly through screen but at the same time, they have also
            been used to promote numerous political gazes and movements. Even horror movies can't be free from this matter. Therefore I would like to ask this question: What is the responsibility of the artist? Is there any social or political
            responsibility? What responsibility and attitude should we have when we make a work?

                From the 1970s to late 1980, it was the prime of slasher horror films and the time when the ‚ÄòFinal Girl' was highly active on the screen. ‚ÄòFinal Girl‚Äô refers to the last girl(s) or woman alive to confront the killer, the one who
                left to tell the story. <i>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i>(1974), <i>Halloween</i>(1978), <i>Alien</i>(1979), <i>Friday the 13th</i>(1980), <i>A Nightmare on Elm street</i>(1984) and <i>Scream</i>(1996) are typical final girl
                horror films. This trope is by Carol J. Clover in her book <i>Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film</i>(1992). Final Girl is an iconic horror trope and usually Final Girl characters are considered as
                symbols of strength, bravery and resilience. However interestingly, despite all the appearances in completely different films, final girls share similar characteristics. Usually they are unisex named young girls on the edge of
                their teens and either uninterested in men or virgin. They are mature or smarter than their peers and in the end of the movie, they survives alone in a dark bloody place and wait for the killer with preparation for revenge of
                their friends or family. Clover describes the character as such:
                <br>
                <blockquote><i>‚ÄúShe is the one who encounters the mutilated bodies of her friends and perceives the full extent of the preceding horror and of her own peril; who is chased, cornered, wounded; whom we see scream, stagger, fall,
                    rise, and scream again.‚Äù</i></blockquote>

                </div>
                <br>
                The movie that best explains the Final Girl theory is <i>Halloween</i>, which can be said to have set the final girl formula with the most iconic Final Girl, Laurie. On October 31, 1963, on Halloween night in the small town of
                Haddonfield, Illinois, six-year-old Michael Myers stabs his older sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife, and is incarcerated at Smith's Grove sanitarium. Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, Michael's psychiatrist Dr.
                Samuel Loomis arrive at the sanitarium to escort Michael to court. Michael escapes by stealing their car and returns to Haddonfield, killing a mechanic. The next day on Halloween, Michael stalks high school student Laurie Strode
                throughout the day and she notices, but her friends Annie and Lynda dismiss her concerns. Later that night, Michael kills Laurie's friends one by one. Eventually Laurie becomes a final girl who remains alone and struggles with
                Michael who wants to kill her too. Meanwhile, Loomis witnessed Laurie was making children ran away to another house down the street. Directly he chased after Laurie and Michael and at the peak of their struggle, Loomis shoots
                Michael. Barely saved and terrored Laurie asks Loomis if Michael was a ‚ÄòBogeyman‚Äô and Loomis replies, ‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, it was.‚Äù Then he looks down over the balcony to check Michael, but he is already gone. The film ends
                with a view of Myers House, where Michael committed his first murder.

                The main character, Laurie, is a typical Final Girl of Clover. She is a character that
                no one hates and hard to hate. Who can hate a shy, polite and smart but unpretentious girl? Laurie is the ‚Äòunfeminine‚Äô female protagonist. The ‚Äòunfeminine‚Äô in the movie means intelligent, careful, and exploratory aspect of
                Laurie. For this reason, Laurie is compared to her ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô friends like Annie and Linda throughout the movie. In a book <i>Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film</i>(1992), Clover states that the slasher
                film resolves it either through eliminating the woman or reconstituting her as masculine(Final Girl). In <i>Revisiting the Final Girl: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards</i>, Katarzyna Paszkiewicz writes:
                <br>
                <blockquote><i>‚ÄúPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Clover‚Äôs formulation has been the characterization of the Final Girl as a ‚Äòmale in drag‚Äô, which referes to her presumed masculine aggression and phallic agency.‚Äù</i>
                </blockquote><br>
                <div align=center>
                  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/H7H92AO.jpg" width="100%" class="responsive">
                  <font class="note"><i>Halloween (1978)</i></font>
                </div>
                <br>
                <i>Halloween</i> ultimately erases all the ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô characters like Annie and Linda and leave only Laurie, the only ‚Äòunfeminine‚Äô girl in the film. Laurie is a character with masculinity, and that is why her survival is
                allowed. At the time, the Final Girls were designed for male audiences. The reason was that teenage boys were expected to be main audiences of slasher film. Therefore, the Final Girls in the movie should be attractive to male
                audiences, but at the same time they could be immersed and identified with them. Final Girl is the complex fantasy existence that satisfied men‚Äôs desires while not harming male power and masculinity, based on their sadistic
                voyeurism. Clover states that in order for the film to succeed, even if the final girl is masculinized, it is important that the final girl is female because she must experience abject terror, begging for her life, and most of
                audiences would reject a horror film that showed abject terror on the part of a male. Are there any of horror movies featuring Final Boy? If you say yes, then can you answer that Final Boys also followed these Final Girl
                rules?<br>
                <br><br>

                  <font class="note"><i>Thomasin of The Witch (2015), Erin of You‚Äôre Next (2011)</i></font>
                </div>
                <br>

                But despite all of the problems, there's a funny part of the Final Girl theory. Since there is no typical ‚Äòstrong‚Äô male character in the film, the final girls become masculinized power icons in the horror genre. In modern horror
                films, the classic and typical Final Girls mentioned above are disappearing. The existence of the Final Girl itself has not disappeared, but it exists in a new and different way. Thomasin of <i>The Witch</i>(2015) is a good
                example. Set in 17th century New England, the film shows a very conservative and patriarchal Puritan family. Threatening Thomasin throughout the film is her family, more than witches. For no reason, all the arrows are turn to
                their eldest daughter, Thomasin. They blame her for her brother's mysterious death, considering sending her to another house and her father even locks her in a barn. Her family firmly believes she is a witch and she is accused
                of witchcraft throughout the whole movie. In the end of the film, she becomes the Final Girl who last survived among the cursed families, make a deal with Satan and joins the coven. She had made her choice with her own will,
                away from the family and religion that abused her. Thomasin denies the rule that the Final Girl must always be pure and be a ‚Äòhuman‚Äô against evil. She face her witchiness and accepts her desire to live freely from the
                patriarchal society. <i>You‚Äôre Next</i>(2011) also features a fresh character who denies the existing Final Girl trope as the main character. Erin's boyfriend's family gathering is attacked by unidentified men in animal masks,
                and at the moment of desperation, Erin begins to fight back. The villains of the movie quickly become Erin‚Äôs ‚Äòvictims,‚Äô and Erin knocks the villains down in her own way, one by one. What makes this film different from other
                Final Girl tropes is that the film is not focusing on her screaming and being hurt by killers. The film focuses on her showing formidable power against the villains and beastly punishing them. Audiences can feel the cool
                pleasure through Erin's actions and since she is a final girl who has more common ground with killers than the existing final girls, she completely collapses the existing Final Girl trope. Like these examples, the Final Girls in
                modern horror movies are different from the past with many potentials, and they can bring us something that is lacking in other genres. Horror genre and final girl are the symbols of female-led franchises, and clearly we are
                learning from the past and creating new types of final girls that have been modified and developed for the new era. This is why we should not miss our interest in the Final Girls on the screen, even if opinions about final girl
                trope are divided.
