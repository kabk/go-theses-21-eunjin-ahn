            I loved horror movies since I was a kid. But from a certain point, it was so disturbing to watch horror films so I stopped and it took a long time to be able to watch them again. In horror movies mostly women are hit, raped and killed
            or they are just a monster. Is it possible to be a feminist and horror film fan at the same time?

            <br>
            <br>Over time, the way of illustrating female characters in horror movies is quite different from the past. In this thesis, I classified the way women are consumed in horror movies into four categories. Each chapter will provide direct
            examples through specific films for each type, and I will observe the comparison the way female characters are portrayed in past horror films versus the way female characters are portrayed in modern horror films. I will analyze the gaze
            we look at horror movies and create an opportunity to think about new directions for horror movies to move forward. Furthermore, I would like to ask what attitude and responsibility we should have as artists through this research.

                It takes a lot of excuses to explain why you love horror movies. Since <i>L'arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat</i>(1896), many genres have been
                created in the history of movies, and various films have been created, but there is no genre regarded as the lowest echelon of movie society as horror. There is a widespread atmosphere that horror movies are terrible and
                stimulating, and only people who have serious mental problems like horror movies. But horror has always been around us and we are instinctively fascinated by
                horror.<br>
                <blockquote><a href="#foot1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-1"><i>‚ÄúSo he spoke, and Lycaon‚Äôs heart failed him, his knees likewise, and letting go the spear he sank to the ground his arms outstretched. But Achilles,
                      drawing his keen sword, struck him on the neck and collarbone, the
                      double-edged blade biting through, so he fell headlong in the dust, and the black blood ran out and soaked the earth.‚Äù</i><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>
                This cruel murder scene is a part of the classic The Iliad. Like Hendrick Goltzius‚Äô <a href="#foot2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-2"><i>The Dragon Devouring the Companions of Cadmus</i>(1588)<sup>2</sup></a>, which
                depicts the image of the dragon chewing the head of a person, all kinds of visual
                images of Jesus' hardships and the brutal accomplishments of mythical heroes repeated in historical paintings, sculptures and literature.

                <br><br>
                Horror is a genre that is not awkward for women to take up all the posters. <a href="#foot3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-3">Usually in horror films, female character‚Äôs time of appearance in the film is more than half
                  of the screening time.<sup>3</sup></a> It is hard to find a genre where women
                are as lead rolls as this. Google analyzed 100 films and found out horror genre is the only genre that female character‚Äôs time of appearance in the film is more than half of the screening time. February 24, 2017, Google, along with
                the Gina Davis Foundation, used machine learning to analyze the top 100 films in the box office among the films released in the United States for three years from 2014 to 2016, and released a survey of the degree of gender equality
                in movies. The analysis showed that the average time of women's appearance in all genres except horror movies was less than half of the screening time. Therefore, it is not awkward to say that horror film is the most female-driven
                movie. But ironically, behind them, there is a long-standing misogyny. Those who scream, be anxious and become subject to violence are female characters. The existence that feels fear and anxiety in the movie and makes the audience
                feel fear is usually a women or a woman-like creature and they cause fear and disgust, sometimes twisted pleasure, to the audience who watches horror movies. In particular, they are described as isolated people from the outside,
                people with little place to rely on, or as people who are treated as geeks. There are also horror films in which both female and male characters are the main characters. In a film in which non-individual groups are the main
                characters, female characters and male characters are mixed but they are bound by a certain sexual relationship. The film depicts their sexual relationship, sexualizing the body of a female character and leading the audience to
                consume it sexually. Unnecessary sexual scenes or shower scenes are the good examples. The way female characters are depicted in horror films is not much different from the way women are fetishized in pornography. Sex and horror are
                inseparable relationships, especially in pornographic horrors and slasher subgenres.<br>

                By looking at depictions of women through the lens of horror movie history, we can recognize the power of representation and how it interacts with society. The portrayal of women in horror movies is not much different from the way
                people treat women in real society. It can be said that it is the social structure of reality. There are certainly some people who compare female characters in old literature and old TV shows, saying how much better women‚Äôs social
                status is better than before thanks to the feminist movement. Or some can talk about the Ripley of <i>Alien</i>(1979) and talk about how she was a revolutionary and wonderful horror heroine character. Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of
                Ellen Ripley was groundbreaking in 1979 but they do not know that even such Ripley has limitations. But over time, as we come to modern times, there are more and more female characters in various horror movies that have evolved. The
                world and the world of horror movies are slowly but surely improving. Therefore, I think there should be more criticism and theory of feminist gaze toward horror movies which is female characters make up more than half of screen
                time. The link between film and politics is not easy to see at first sight, but like other artworks, the film is a political medium. Films have been used to tell stories vividly through screen but at the same time, they have also
                been used to promote numerous political gazes and movements. Even horror movies can't be free from this matter. Therefore I would like to ask this question: What is the responsibility of the artist? Is there any social or political
                responsibility? What responsibility and attitude should we have when we make a work?

                    From the 1970s to late 1980, it was the prime of slasher horror films and the time when the ‚ÄòFinal Girl' was highly active on the screen. ‚ÄòFinal Girl‚Äô refers to the last girl(s) or woman alive to confront the killer, the one who
                    left to tell the story. <i>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i>(1974), <i>Halloween</i>(1978), <i>Alien</i>(1979), <i>Friday the 13th</i>(1980), <i>A Nightmare on Elm street</i>(1984) and <i>Scream</i>(1996) are typical final girl
                    horror films. This trope is by Carol J. Clover in her book <i>Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film</i>(1992). Final Girl is an iconic horror trope and usually Final Girl characters are considered as
                    symbols of strength, bravery and resilience. However interestingly, despite all the appearances in completely different films, final girls share similar characteristics. Usually they are unisex named young girls on the edge of
                    their teens and either uninterested in men or virgin. They are mature or smarter than their peers and in the end of the movie, they survives alone in a dark bloody place and wait for the killer with preparation for revenge of
                    their friends or family. Clover describes the character as such:
                    <br>
                    <blockquote><a href="#foot4" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-4"><i>‚ÄúShe is the one who encounters the mutilated bodies of her friends and perceives the full extent of the preceding horror and of her own peril; who is
                          chased, cornered, wounded; whom we see scream, stagger, fall,
                          rise, and scream again.‚Äù</i><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote>

                    <br>
                    The movie that best explains the Final Girl theory is <i>Halloween</i>, which can be said to have set the final girl formula with the most iconic Final Girl, Laurie. On October 31, 1963, on Halloween night in the small town of
                    Haddonfield, Illinois, six-year-old Michael Myers stabs his older sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife, and is incarcerated at Smith's Grove sanitarium. Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, Michael's psychiatrist Dr.
                    Samuel Loomis arrive at the sanitarium to escort Michael to court. Michael escapes by stealing their car and returns to Haddonfield, killing a mechanic. The next day on Halloween, Michael stalks high school student Laurie Strode
                    throughout the day and she notices, but her friends Annie and Lynda dismiss her concerns. Later that night, Michael kills Laurie's friends one by one. Eventually Laurie becomes a final girl who remains alone and struggles with
                    Michael who wants to kill her too. Meanwhile, Loomis witnessed Laurie was making children ran away to another house down the street. Directly he chased after Laurie and Michael and at the peak of their struggle, Loomis shoots
                    Michael. Barely saved and terrored Laurie asks Loomis if Michael was a ‚ÄòBogeyman‚Äô and Loomis replies, ‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, it was.‚Äù Then he looks down over the balcony to check Michael, but he is already gone. The film ends
                    with a view of Myers House, where Michael committed his first murder.

                    <br>
                    The main character, Laurie, is a typical Final Girl of Clover. She is a character that
                    no one hates and hard to hate. Who can hate a shy, polite and smart but unpretentious girl? Laurie is the ‚Äòunfeminine‚Äô female protagonist. The ‚Äòunfeminine‚Äô in the movie means intelligent, careful, and exploratory aspect of
                    Laurie. For this reason, Laurie is compared to her ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô friends like Annie and Linda throughout the movie. In a book <i>Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film</i>(1992), Clover states that the slasher
                    film resolves it either through eliminating the woman or reconstituting her as masculine(Final Girl). In <i>Revisiting the Final Girl: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards</i>, Katarzyna Paszkiewicz writes:
                    <br>
                    <blockquote><a href="#foot5" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-5"><i>‚ÄúPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Clover‚Äôs formulation has been the characterization of the Final Girl as a ‚Äòmale in drag‚Äô, which referes to
                          her presumed masculine aggression and phallic agency.‚Äù</i><sup>5</sup></a>

                    <br>
                    <i>Halloween</i> ultimately erases all the ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô characters like Annie and Linda and leave only Laurie, the only ‚Äòunfeminine‚Äô girl in the film. Laurie is a character with masculinity, and that is why her survival is
                    allowed. <a href="#foot6" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-6">At the time, the Final Girls were designed for male audiences.<sup>6</sup></a> The reason was that teenage boys were expected to be main audiences of
                    slasher film. Therefore, the Final Girls in the movie should be attractive to male
                    audiences, but at the same time they could be immersed and identified with them. Final Girl is the complex fantasy existence that satisfied men‚Äôs desires while not harming male power and masculinity, based on their sadistic
                    voyeurism. Clover states that in order for the film to succeed, even if the final girl is masculinized, it is important that the final girl is female because she must experience abject terror, begging for her life, and most of
                    audiences would reject a horror film that showed abject terror on the part of a male. <a href="#foot7" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-7">Are there any of horror movies featuring Final Boy? If you say yes, then can

                    <br>

                    But despite all of the problems, there's a funny part of the Final Girl theory. Since there is no typical ‚Äòstrong‚Äô male character in the film, the final girls become masculinized power icons in the horror genre. In modern horror
                    films, the classic and typical Final Girls mentioned above are disappearing. The existence of the Final Girl itself has not disappeared, but it exists in a new and different way. Thomasin of <i>The Witch</i>(2015) is a good
                    example. Set in 17th century New England, the film shows a very conservative and patriarchal Puritan family. Threatening Thomasin throughout the film is her family, more than witches. For no reason, all the arrows are turn to
                    their eldest daughter, Thomasin. They blame her for her brother's mysterious death, considering sending her to another house and her father even locks her in a barn. Her family firmly believes she is a witch and she is accused
                    of witchcraft throughout the whole movie. In the end of the film, she becomes the Final Girl who last survived among the cursed families, make a deal with Satan and joins the coven. She had made her choice with her own will,
                    away from the family and religion that abused her. Thomasin denies the rule that the Final Girl must always be pure and be a ‚Äòhuman‚Äô against evil. She face her witchiness and accepts her desire to live freely from the
                    patriarchal society. <i>You‚Äôre Next</i>(2011) also features a fresh character who denies the existing Final Girl trope as the main character. Erin's boyfriend's family gathering is attacked by unidentified men in animal masks,
                    and at the moment of desperation, Erin begins to fight back. The villains of the movie quickly become Erin‚Äôs ‚Äòvictims,‚Äô and Erin knocks the villains down in her own way, one by one. What makes this film different from other
                    Final Girl tropes is that the film is not focusing on her screaming and being hurt by killers. The film focuses on her showing formidable power against the villains and beastly punishing them. Audiences can feel the cool
                    pleasure through Erin's actions and since she is a final girl who has more common ground with killers than the existing final girls, she completely collapses the existing Final Girl trope. Like these examples, the Final Girls in
                    modern horror movies are different from the past with many potentials, and they can bring us something that is lacking in other genres. Horror genre and final girl are the symbols of female-led franchises, and clearly we are
                    learning from the past and creating new types of final girls that have been modified and developed for the new era. This is why we should not miss our interest in the Final Girls on the screen, even if opinions about final girl
                    trope are divided.

                        Rape revenge horror movies are extremely contradictory. These films have a storyline that seems like raped woman taking a prudent revenge, but when we unpack them it is more like torture pornography. Rape can never be
                        entertainment, but in rape revenge movies, rape acts as a medium of entertainment. The female revenge drama, in which the victim herself or her mother take revenge, received the support of many people in that women who are
                        considered to have poor physical strength and depicted as pure and poor victims take brutal revenge on men. Therefore, despite their terrible way of describing, the films dealing with female revenge became the subject of
                        feminist interpretation, and some characters became symbolic characters of feminism. However, most of the works dealing with female revenge have terrible flaws. Ingmar Bergman‚Äôs <i>The Virgin Spring</i>(1960), which is the
                        first rape revenge horror film does not visually shock the audience with violence, but Wes Craven‚Äôs <i>The Last House on the Left</i>(1972), which is based on <i>The Virgin Spring</i>, makes the audience uncomfortable with
                        its
                        realistic and unpleasant depiction of violence. In the revenge movie, where the male is the main character, the man ends revenge by taking revenge on behalf of his family or girlfriend and becomes a hero, but if the woman is
                        the main character, the story changes. In the revenge movie, where the woman is the main character, the woman becomes the victim and the perpetrator. She is raped, threatened and tortured by a murderer who suddenly appeared
                        in
                        ordinary everyday life. The only way out is revenge, but even if you succeed in revenge, you have to live with a lifetime trauma as a victim. Even in revenge movies, their fate depends on the gender of the protagonist.

                        <br>
                        The rape revenge horror movies utilizes the male gaze to objectify the female body during and after rape. The male gaze, a term coined by Laura Mulvey in <i>Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema</i>, describes the depiction
                        of
                        female characters in a sexualized, de-humanizing manner. According to her because the media depict women as they are observed through the male gaze, women tend to take on this male perspective. According to this theory,
                        women
                        largely appear on screen for men‚Äôs erotic pleasure. As Mulvey states,
                        <br>
                        <blockquote><a href="#foot8" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-8"><i>‚ÄúThe cinema offers a number of possible pleasures. One is scopophilia(pleasure in looking). There are circumstances in which looking itself is a
                              source of pleasure.‚Äù</i><sup>8</sup></a></blockquote>


                        The male gaze is used to eroticize the female body on screen and makes the audience watch, voyeurize and consume her sexually. Then the body of a woman become a fantasy place where men can freely solve their desires. <a
                          href="#foot9" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-9">The
                          camera acts as a male gaze, and it is sexually objectified by sweeping the body parts of women and this is an act of eroticizing women who are survivors and victims.<sup>9</sup></a>

                        Meir Zarchi's <i>I Spit on Your Grave</i>(1978) is not much out of this. <i>I Spit on Your Grave</i> is a classic that cannot be missed from this topic and is a pastiche of the aforementioned <i>The Last House on the
                          Left</i>.
                        Jennifer, the main character of the film, is a writer who moved from New York to a cabin in the countryside to write novels. She tries to spend a peaceful everyday life in there, but peace does not last long. One day, local
                        men violently raped and left her for dead. But Jennifer, who has barely survived, tracks the rapists without missing a single one and performs a brutal revenge. The most famous scene would be Jennifer cutting off the penis
                        of
                        one of the rapists, causing him to die from bleeding. This film is told from Jennifer‚Äôs point of view so that there is no sense of sharing the rapist‚Äôs pleasure. However this film claim to be ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô and the ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô
                        rape scene is 30 minutes out of 108 minutes of running time, and it has been talked about until now 40 years after its release due to its serious cruelty and violence. Roger Ebert writes, <a href="#foot10"

                          Jen of <i>Revenge</i>(2017)
                        </div><br>
                        The film that strongly criticizes these characteristics is <i>Revenge</i>(2017). The film sharply criticized hyper-masculinity, male gaze, and gender stereotype. Its theme of rape and revenge is the same theme <i>I Spit on
                          Your Grave</i>used but it is different from the sadistic scopophilia of <i>I Spit on Your Grave</i>. Jen, the main character of <i>Revenge</i>, is a sugar-baby type pretty woman like a Barbie doll and she is a girlfriend
                        of
                        wealthy guy named Richard, who owns a palatial and glass-fronted mansion. Both of them and Richard‚Äôs disreputable friends arrive for an unannounced hunting trip and when Richard is away, one guy raped Jen and the other sat
                        on
                        it. Richard, who returned, seemed resentful but within a single night he promised Jen a financial reward and forced her to cover the case. Jen tried to escape from them, but fell off the cliff by Richard and left for dead.
                        When our patience reached the pole by building up the displeasure like this, the <i>Revenge</i> turned into a live show, and Jen, who died unfairly literally reborn as the female warrior type character and takes revenge on
                        Richard and his friends. The overall plot of the film is not much different from the <i>I Spit on Your Grave</i>. But the way Revenge describe rape scene is different from <i>I Spit on Your Grave</i> and <i>The Last House on
                          the Left</i>. At the beginning of the movie, the image of the apple that is eaten by ants is shown sequentially and in the scene where Jen is raped, the sidelined guy is seen eating snacks. Both images are approached with
                        close-up, and are visually and auditorily directed emphatically in comparison to other scenes so although it is not visually violent, but it expresses the violence of assault very well. Like this, <i>Revenge</i> showed
                        excellent appearance without direct and excessive violence scene in describing ‚Äòuncomfort‚Äô which is the biggest driving force of story. Some people say Jen‚Äôs miraculous survival is unrealistic and unlikely, but do movies
                        need
                        to be realistic and probable?

                        Opinions on Rape-revenge horror move are still divided over half a century, but the exciting, cool ending of Jen‚Äôs revenge on everyone gives the women the excitement which can not be said. Something in us meets very
                        primitive
                        feelings and makes us feel pleasure. In real life, women are always exposed to men‚Äôs hate crimes and easily feel anxious. As society‚Äôs misogyny gets worse, women try to calm their anger by consuming the media that can
                        empathize and relieve stress. As this situation is repeated, well-made female revenge film like Revenge becomes a new refuge for women. But when the movie ends, we end up in an exciting and unpleasant dilemma since the
                        reality
                        is very different from these movies. However, <i>Revenge</i> released during the era of the #MeToo and was enough to be a satisfactory refuge for women. Just before a man rapes Jen, he tells Jen, who refuses him: <i>What is
                          it
                          you don't like about me? Why am I not your type? Yesterday, you were dying for it.</i>There will be no female audience who does not feel familiar with this scene. A well-made female revenge film like Revenge does not
                        illustrate rape scenes as pornography and eroticize victims, but minimizes rape scenes in a wise way, address the reality of sexual assault and most importantly, supports sexual assault survivors. They twist the
                        already-existent female exploitative plots and directing to create more empowering and refreshing feminist rape revenge horror movie. They present a new gaze that can replace male gaze and deal with this complex topic with
                        carefulness, cleverness and power. Even though the world has changed a lot, it is still a society where women‚Äôs injustice is difficult to solve and victims live in hiding. Shouldn‚Äôt this fantasy be acceptable?

                              Wendy of <i>The Shining</i>(1980)

                            </div>

                            <br>
                            In any media, the ‚Äòmother‚Äô character really appears a lot and has a considerable symbolism. This is the same in the horror film world. From the 1970s, mother characters in horror movies began to play a pretty big role.
                            Mothers in horror movies can usually be divided into two types. They are the ‚Äòbad mother‚Äô, demonic beings who create monsters in abusive and incorrect parenting (<i>Carrie</i>(1976), <i>The Brood</i>(1979), <i>Friday the
                              13th</i>(1980)), and the ‚Äòpathetic mother‚Äô, complete innocent victim suffering without knowing any conspiracy (<i>The Shining</i>(1980), <i>The Exorcist</i>(1973), <i>Rosemary‚Äôs Baby</i>(1968), <i>The Omen</i>(1976)).
                            The latter, The Shining, can be a good example. Wendy's ‚Äòincompetence‚Äô, which children as well as herself cannot keep properly, makes the audience feel discouraged. In an interview with BBC, <a href="#foot12"
                              aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-12">Stephen King admits that he's no fan of the film and that Wendy is ‚ÄúOne of the most misogynistic characters ever put on film.‚Äù<sup>12</sup></a>, and explain that she is
                            ‚ÄúBasically just there to scream and be stupid and that‚Äôs not the woman that I wrote about.‚Äù In the original novel Wendy described as <a href="#foot13" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-13">‚ÄúA brave, courageous
                              woman whose heroics help save her son, herself, and Dick Halloran.‚Äù<sup>13</sup></a> by Danny‚Äôs friend and the chef at Overlook Hotel.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Childhood development is a common concern regardless of country and culture, and it is a frequent theme that can not be separated from the mothers in horror movies. Nancy Chodorow, who is an important voice in feminism,
                            mothering and psychoanalysis states that <a href="#foot14" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-14">‚Äúan investigation of the child‚Äôs experience of being mothered shows that fundamental expectations of women as
                              mothers emerge during this period.‚Äù<sup>14</sup></a> Thus, psychoanalysis theory studies the maturity of children according to the mother‚Äôs parenting style, but also determines what kind of parenting is appropriate and
                            inappropriate. In <i>Maternal Horror Film: Melodrama and Motherhood</i>, Sarah Arnold writes:
                            <br>
                            <blockquote><a href="#foot15" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-15"><i>‚ÄúIn accounting for the formation of the subject, psychoanalytic theory also provides a template for successful mothering, which may in turn
                                  be accused (and indeed has been accused) of being ideologically motivated. Thus, psychoanalytic theory can be considered political in the sense that it touches upon wider issues regarding gender and social
                                  hierarchies. Although it claims to shed light on the unconscious and the psychic structures which constitute subjectivity, feminist psychoanalysts are careful to note the social organizations which determine the
                                  power dynamics that are productive of gendered subjectivity.‚Äù</i><sup>15</sup></a></blockquote>


                            For this reason. there are controversy and contradictions exist about maternal. The image of gender role of men and women in society has a long history but it is the mother who stands out for the character of the role
                            most. The men have been forced to be work and have a career life to support his family and the women has been forced to be a lovely mother who lives in the house and does her best to her husband and child. Mothers should
                            be pure and moral, care for their children much more than their fathers, and be more closely related to them. In Jane Swigart‚Äôs <i>The Myth of the Bad Mother: The Emotional Realities of Mothering</i>, she expresses
                            maternal love:
                            <br>
                            <blockquote><a href="#foot16" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-16"><i>‚ÄúMaternal love requires many different skills and behaviors. In addition to physical care‚Ä¶all children need certainty that the care-giver
                                  will not abandon them as they begin to enjoy more autonomy ‚Ä¶I use the term maternal love because it more readily suggests the constant giving of care and protection‚Ä¶without asking anything in return.‚Äù</i></a><a

                              <i>The Brood</i>(1979)
                            </div><br>
                            <i>The Brood</i>(1979) is a film that emphasizes the importance of the right childhood development and monstrousizes and criticizes ‚Äòbad mother‚Äô without maternal love. Cronenberg claimed that <i>The Brood</i> was based
                            on a traumatized experience of his divorce and custody battle and this is explicit in the way the film deals with the mother of this film, Nola. The film is portrayed in her husband‚Äôs view and describes him as a better
                            guardian than Nola. <i>The brood</i> is about husband Frank struggling to have custody of Candice, who discovered Nola abused their daughter Candice. He informs Dr. Raglan, who was psychotherapy of Nola that Nola abused
                            Candice, but Dr. Raglan refuses to make Nola and Frank meet. Frank used to leave Candice to Nola‚Äôs parents sometimes but her mother and father are killed in turn, and when her father is murdered, Frank succeeds in
                            catching up a deformed-looking killer. The killer is later dissected, and the doctor speculates that the killer was not human or was not born into the world the way a common human was born. Suddenly, after a series of
                            serial murders, Dr. Raglan suddenly discharges all patients in the clinic, but leaves Nola alone. Frank, who has continued to distrust and doubt Dr. Raglan, is looking for those who were patients Dr. Raglan, and patients
                            are talking about the side effects of his treatment. Meanwhile, while Candice is in kindergarten, deformed humans who murdered Nola‚Äôs parents appear, killing even kindergarten teacher Ruth and kidnapping Candice.
                            Afterwards, Candice becomes a missing child and Frank, who thought Dr. Raglan had a grudge because of all the circumstances, headed to the clinic to find his daughter and hear the shocking news through Dr. Raglan. The
                            deformed humans who committed the murder were all creatures born by his wife, Nola. Later, while Dr. Raglan rescues Candice, who is being held by deformed humans, Frank attempts to talk to his wife Nola. He apologize to
                            her and saying that he want to be together again and promise to share everything. She then shows her ‚Äòside effect‚Äô through the treatment of Dr. Raglan, which is her external womb. The truth was the anger towards the
                            mother who abused her, the anger towards the father who was on the sidelines, and the anger towards Ruth, who was considered to take away her husband Frank from her, appeared as Nola‚Äôs external womb and Nola‚Äôs deformed
                            babies, condensed by the anger born through this, killed Nola‚Äôs parents and Ruth. When Frank tries to coax Nola, who became a monster, into sweet talk, Nola gets mad and the deformed humans were running around and kill
                            Dr. Raglan. When deformed humans try to kill even Candice, Frank, who has lost his temper in the screams of his daughter, kills Nola. Because the mother is dead, all the deformed humans who act according to Nola‚Äôs
                            feelings are all killed. In the end Frank finally managed to get his daughter Candice out of the clinic but in a car that then exits the clinic, we all can see Candice has the same pustules as Nola had and this shows
                            that abuse perpetuates. Thus, <i>The Brood</i> portrays Nola‚Äôs mother and Nola as ‚Äòbad mothers‚Äô and family members become subject to hatred from each other and break-up by their perpetual child abuse. No one in the movie
                            considers that Nola is also a victim of wrong childhood development due to mother abuse and father‚Äôs neglect. Her only ally is Dr. Raglan, but he also promoted her anger and made her a monster, not providing any cures or
                            solutions for the future. So rather than offering a solution to the phenomenon, <i>The Brood</i> just focuses on monstrousizing Nola and showing how bad mother she is and how bad it affects her child. As Carrie Rickey
                            points out in her essay, <i>The Brood: Separation Trials</i>,
                            <br>
                            <blockquote><a href="#foot18" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-18"><i>‚ÄúIn the judgment of film historian Robin Wood, his most outspoken critic, Cronenberg consistently exhibited his dread of women by creating
                                  monstrous, voracious, and repellent female characters.‚Äù</i><sup>18</sup></a></blockquote>

                            In <i>The Brood</i>, we can see Frank‚Äôs efforts to protect and rescue his daughter, and to fight against the legal system that mother should have custody because of ‚Äòmotherhood.‚Äô Nola also tries to have custody, but
                            rather than worrying about Candice and caring about her, she shows her desire to maintain the image of a normal family and is obsessed with her husband. Frank is therefore described as a less selfish and more domestic
                            person than Nola, and the film depicts Nola as a typical bad mother and villain through Frank killing her without much regret and rescuing Candice. Like this, Nola is a villain and monster who does not have motherhood
                            and harms the child with a wrong parenting method in <i>The Brood</i>, and the film says that she is not qualified as a mother.

                            </div><br>
                            However, horror movies are beginning to show reality rather than fantasy. Current horror movies show mother is not a complete being without a single defect and offering a realistic proposal for the future. It is
                            <i>Babadook</i>(2014) that broke the beginning. On her way to the hospital with her husband for childbirth, Amelia lost her husband in a car accident. Fortunately, Amelia gives birth safely, but she loses her husband and
                            raises the baby alone. Samuel, the son of Amelia, who turned seven, suffers from hyperactivity disorder and continues to make her stressed by get in trouble at school. Meanwhile, strange things continue to happen after
                            Samuel read a fairy tale book called <i>The Babadook</i>. Samuel keeps shouting that Babadook appears, and strange phenomena occur in his eyes, but people around him do not understand. Rather, people think that the
                            mother abuses her son. Babadook, which was not a simple fairy tale but a forbidden book containing the curse of evil spirits, digs deep into the daily life of Amelia and Samuel and continues to be unknown what is reality
                            and what is fantasy. Amelia, who suffered from the hallucinations of Babaduk and eventually lost her body to Babadook, lost her reason and tries to kill Samuel. At the end of the movie, with Samuel‚Äôs effort and love
                            towards his mother, Amelia drives the Babadook out of her body. The identity of Babaduk is Amelia‚Äôs dark side filled with parenting stress and trauma. The burden of having to build a family alone, the insecurity and
                            anxiety about a son with a disability, and the hardness and resentment of admitting her husband‚Äôs death have returned as Babaduk. There are two options for Amelia: turn away from the Babadook or face him. Not only the
                            expectation for mother in the society described above, most women believe that if they endure more in home, work, school, and relationships with someone, they can change the situation in a positive direction if they
                            become more kind and friendly. But can the world change so easily like that? It is a cruel and cold world that even my own child is not my will. There can be no such easy shortcut for a mother who is struggling with
                            housework, childcare and wage labor. In this situation, being a mother who responds to everyone with a warm smile, endure problematic child and shows patience and compassion that transcends human limitations is
                            impossible. Amelia‚Äôs appearance of screaming at her son, wielding violence and threatening him is far from the traditional mother we know. It shatters our mother image of ‚Äòalways kind, loving and benevolent mother‚Äô. Even
                            if he is a beloved child, when he destroys me and tests my patience to the limit, there is no mother in the world who can endure and embrace everything like an angel. There is no human being with a steel-like mental
                            power that never collapses in any situation. The degree of weakness does not vary according to gender. It is the way that the inner side becomes sick, the emotions die and torture oneself in fear and anxiety. That anger
                            and pain eventually come back to us as a Babadook.

                            <br><br>
                            <i>Babadook</i> says our fear and trauma cannot be overcome and disappear but we can recognize and accept them and coexist together for the rest of our lives. Women should look at their inner Babadook. For Amelia,
                            Babadook is not gone, but just locked up for a while. Therefore Babadook will hide somewhere inside Amelia and appear again when Amelia is weakened. But Amelia now knows how to control Babadook. This is because it is
                            different from the previous time when she did not admit her fear and ran without courage. In the movie, Robbie says, <i>Life‚Äôs too short</i>. How should we live the life that is given to everyone only one? We have to
                            live together with our flaws, not endure or endure. You have to be brave to notice, acknowledge, and accept the fear inside of you and the perfect mother in mythology does not exist in reality.

                                Usually monsters are expressed as beings with masculine characteristics, and female monsters are significantly less than male monsters. Therefore, the discourse around horror films has always been the composition of
                                male monsters versus female victims. Monsters were mostly male and women were the objects that monsters wanted to take, and they existed as rewards for men when they fought monsters. The male monsters in Hollywood
                                horror films have been reproduced as werewolves, vampires, zombies, apes, monsters, and cannibals. They reproduces the fear of the weak and vulnerable in society and the dark and bizarre side of our unconscious
                                nature. On the other hand, female monsters in Western films appear as mothers, witches, vampires and castration. The female monsters in the patriarchal and phallic world are closely related to the problems of sex
                                difference and castration. <i>The Exorcist</i>(1973), the main character of a possessed girl, <i>Carrie</i>(1976), featuring a witchy mother and a daughter who became a monster showed female monsters with a strong
                                presence as ‚Äòmonsters‚Äô, but their femininity and monstrous nature were not closely analyzed together for a long time.

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <i>In The Monstrous Feminine</i> <a href="#foot19" aria-describedby="foot-19" id="foot-19">Barbara Creed explains five types of female monsters (the archaic mother, the monstrous womb, the witch, the vampire and the
                                  possessed women) along with three features of female monsters in relation to Julia Kristeva‚Äôs theory of the abject and motherhood.<sup>19</sup></a> In Kristeva‚Äôs essay, the abject means what disturbs identity,
                                system and order. Hollywood's horror film depicts abjection in at least three ways. First, horror films are overflowing with filthy images of the abject such as shit, blood, urine, pus and the bodies, which are mixed
                                with the flesh. Second, monsters in horror films break down and threaten all boundaries, including human and inhuman, man and beast, normal and the supernatural, good and evil, and the border of gender roles.
                                Thirdly, Horror films constitute the maternal characteristics of women as the abject. Creed quotes Kristeva and criticizes Freud to analyzes the female image in the horror film. Freud said that humans feel fear from
                                ‚Äòthe return of the repressed‚Äô. This can be interpreted as ‚Äòuncanny‚Äô defined by him. Freud explains that when the otherness, which was socially oppressed returns, humans feel bizarre and this leads to fear. If the
                                original familiarity is oppressed, the object becomes ‚Äòthe other‚Äô and becomes the unfamiliar one. Something oppressed always struggles to return, and this unfamiliar thing that has returned becomes the other and
                                gives fear to humans. Freud claims that women are threatening because they are castrated, and assumes female monsters as images of ‚Äòcastrating woman‚Äô and ‚Äòpallic mother.‚Äô Creed writes:
                                <br>
                                <blockquote><a href="#foot20" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-20"><i>‚ÄúRepresentations of woman as an agent of castration take various forms in the horror film: oral sadistic mother (the vampire film);
                                      femme castratrice (the woman‚Äôs revenge film); castrating mother (family horror). Recurring images and motifs associated with woman as castrator include knives, axes, ice picks, spiked instruments, teeth,
                                      yawning chasms, jagged rocks, the deadly vagina dentata. In comparison with other genres, the horror genre does not attempt to soothe castration anxiety.‚Äù</i><sup>20</sup></a></blockquote>


                                Looking back at the images of female monsters on the screen, Creed refutes Freud‚Äôs old declaration. Are you afraid of women because they are castrated, or are you afraid of being castrated by them?

                                  Carrie of <i>Carrie</i>(1976)

                                </div><br>
                                <i>Carrie</i>(1976) is a representative work that does not fall out of the subject of female monsters and connects the life characteristics and fear of women, such as menarche, rites of passage, primitiveness and
                                motherhood. There are controls, fears, and punishments that show patriarchal order around the menstruation and sexuality of adolescent women. In <i>Carrie</i>, Carrie is a girl who suffers from adolescence and is
                                portrayed as a supernatural being, not ‚Äònormal‚Äô. She is forced to be chastised by her morbidly devout mother and bullied by everyone in school. One day she had her first period at the school and teased by her
                                classmate because she has not been properly educated about it. After menarche, the superpowers that were latent to her begin to emerge: ability to move objects freely without touching them. Carrie‚Äôs mother tries to
                                suppress the superpowers that come down to the household for generations more intensely, thinking of them as the ‚Äòpower of the devil.‚Äô But Carrie decides to escape her mother‚Äôs oppression and begins to communicate
                                with the world. Carrie, who was obedient and introverted to her mother, finally overpowers her mother with her psychic powers, and attends a prom party in her own dress. However, the group that bothered Carrie
                                manipulated Carrie to be elected prom queen and poured pig blood when she was at the best moment on stage. This blood means shame and insult, and at the same time it is an opportunity to awaken Carrie's supernatural
                                power. With this blood, Carrie's revenge begins. This film is the best example of the concept of ‚Äòreturned the other‚Äô mentioned above. The miserable being who was suppressed and harassed returns to the monster and
                                gives fear to everyone. Carrie, who became a monster, expresses the anger that has been suppressed to the students and mothers of the school, becomes a monster and finally be honest and free with her own desires.

                                  Justine of <i>Raw</i>(2016)

                                </div><br>
                                The similar type of modern female horror film is <i>Raw</i>(2016). <i>Raw</i> is a genre that touches the tradition of horror films such as Carrie and <i>Ginger Snaps</i>(2000). These horror films define the
                                sexuality of a teenage girl as dangerous and abnormal, and the metaphor makes the main character perceive a superpower or a heterogeneous identity. <i>Raw</i> takes <i>Carrie</i>‚Äôs formula but goes to the most
                                radical way without repeating the clich√©. Growing up under strict vegetarian parents, Justine enters the famous veterinary school where her sister Alexia attends. The veterinary department she experienced is far from
                                respecting animals, and is full of masculine, highly hierarchical cultures. Women are subject to sexual harassment, and gay men are subject to ridicule. After a harsh freshman ceremony in which Justine had to force
                                herself to eat animal intestines, she feels an intense desire for raw meat, which she has never felt in her life. Justine feels a sense of satisfaction that she has never experienced before by eating raw meat. One
                                day, while she was being waxed by her sister, Justine accidentally cut off one of her sister‚Äôs finger and while waiting for an ambulance, she even failed to overcome her desire and eats that finger. After this
                                terrible accident, Justine goes through a radical shift from abstinence to cannibalism. The changes Justin experiences when she becomes a freshman are so radical and extreme. The sexual desire and deviation that
                                started to run through brutal rites of passage, and the blood-stained cannibalism that symbolizes it, are shocking, but offer the audience some sense of excitement and joy. Young women, who are consumed only as
                                sexual ‚Äòbody‚Äô by men, subversively eat the ‚Äòbody‚Äô of men and take the position of predators instead of men. The film rejects the boundaries and taboos between the human and the inhuman and shows the abject like
                                rashes, hair, raw meat, biting, and vomiting, and questions about a woman's body. In the end of the film, when Justine finds out that her cannibal desires come from her motherhood, she faces ethical choices. Should I
                                live as a strict vegetarian like my mother, or will I be judged by society by releasing my desires like my sister?

                                Feminist critic Hee-jung Son explained that women who do not embody the value that the patriarchy wants become monsters that threaten normality. She said,
                                <br>
                                <blockquote><a href="#foot21" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="foot-21"><i>‚ÄúWomen who express free sexuality or who are not qualified as mothers as defined by society become monsters because patriarchy do not
                                      want them.‚Äù</i><sup>21</sup></a></blockquote>


                                The place where excluded female characters could head was limited. It was a horror movie where the extinct female characters could take the stage. Many female monsters were revealing the position of women who could
                                not show up or speak properly unless they were in horror movies. It is a place where the fear shared in this society become visible and the suppressed minority returns to the monster. The simple and obvious basic
                                formula of horror movies is that ‚Äònormality is threatened by monsters‚Äô. Strange beings threaten normality, and beings that disturb normality become monsters. The exclusions from the everyday space return when the
                                space becomes a non-daily space. Therefore one of the important things in the horror genre is the stage and the background. This is because the horror genre reflects our society and culture. The most absurd place in
                                society is the place of horror.

                                <i>The Woman</i>(2011) shows wild female monster that confront civilization in the background of a harsh patriarchal family. In <i>The Woman</i>, the space of horror is a home in which a violent, psychopath father
                                wields enormous power within his family. The lawyer who happened to witness the last wild cannibal woman (the woman) who was alive in the woods of North America, Cleek capture her with the hunting net. He lock her in
                                underground bunker and try to ‚Äòcivilize‚Äô her. Outside the house, he is a good lawyer with a good manner, but in the house he is a tyrant who reigns against his wife, son, and two daughters. He shares the taming of
                                women with family members as he breeds wildlife. As the conflict of the family deepens due to the woman, and the eldest daughter releases the woman, the whole situation turns into a crucible of slaughter due to the
                                revenge of the woman. In this movie, the symbolism of each character is important. There is clearly a critical message for patriarchal system, the male violence and its intergenerational transfer. In <i>The
                                  Woman</i>, Cleek‚Äôs authority comes from the obedience of the surrounding people. The civilization and edification that Cleek said is a work that eventually destroys the free will of existence and converts it into a
                                state of obeying his orders. It's a resemblance to the colonial regime of whites. In capitalist material civilization, a region with weak aggression becomes a colony in a strong area, but in a civilization divided by
                                gender, women become a male colony. Cleek, who hunts the woman from wild and locks her in a prison called the patriarchy under the name of civilization, controls her wildness and desires, and commits terrible
                                violence, is a civilized person? Through <i>The Woman</i>, the director asks us what real ‚Äòcivilization‚Äô is. In the end, after brutally killing her torturers the woman leaves to start the new tribe of women which
                                does not have any male power, with the remaining female characters, which is a new and very satisfying ending.

                                What scares us in horror movies is that the solid order of this world we are living in is so precarious. But at the same time, the point where horror movies attract and enchant us is the truth that solid order of the
                                world, which seems to be impossible to overturn with the power of each of us, is, in fact, only such a precarious one. The female monsters stand at the boundary between the consciousness and the unconscious,
                                embodying hidden anxiety and fear all over their bodies and interrogating the ‚Äòfather‚Äôs order.‚Äô¬†Emancipating women‚Äôs bodies and sexuality from normativeness will give women a tremendous boost. They criticize how
                                male-dominated humanity has been and shows how to successfully simulate genres under paternal tradition. Female monsters in horror movies are getting more and more in recent years. <i>Ginger Snaps</i>(2000),
                                <i>Teeth</i>(2007), <i>Jennifer‚Äôs Body</i>(2009) can be a good examples. Women are still afraid to be monsters or evil women. But these female monsters give us a message that it is okay. They eliminate viewer‚Äôs
                                personal fears by inviting viewers to identify themselves with monsters and facing the dark side of their own. Female monsters in horror movies are not just ugly monsters born of men‚Äôs fear for castrating women, but
                                new idols that women can empathy and empower themselves.

                                    One of the reasons we are fascinated by horror movies is that we face unethical and immorality that are taboo in society. We can experience the taboos and unethical behaviors defined through social and moral
                                    oppressions indirectly through horror movies and feel free. But we don‚Äôt just feel liberated and pleasant. It is possible to understand what is unethical and immoral and what the price comes when they collapse.
                                    However, this is only true for those who have a good sense of ethical consciousness. It is impossible that everyone‚Äôs level of ethical consciousness is exemplary, and creators should keep it in their mind. The
                                    public learns from the media various times and spaces that they have not actually experienced. As a social being, individuals are socialized by learning the common reality, the so-called mutual subjective
                                    reality, shared with other social beings. The reason why learning of mutual subjective reality is possible is because there is an opportunity to objectify subjective experience and share it with others by
                                    symbols. Among them, the media lists a series of symbols to select, emphasize, or exclude specific contents. Therefore, it can be understood that the media repeating the reproduction and explanation of a specific
                                    way is a political act that reproduces social awareness and value. Media, without worrying about whether it is a problem, supports the cultural norms and beliefs of society and shows the contents that justify and
                                    strengthen the current system. Also, most of them show only the values and emotions of the social majority and the way in which events are delivered is also more likely to prefer typical and familiar narrative
                                    methods. Like the final girl trope, rape revenge movie formulas, mother characters, and female monsters that appeared repeatedly with deep misogyny in horror movies.<br><br>

                                      <i>A Girl of A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i>(2014)
                                    </div>

                                    <br>
                                    We still watch male-dominated films from the male-dominated film industry. What should not be forgotten is that the disappearance of women on the screen is not just the area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äòentertainment‚Äô. It is a very
                                    political survival issue. Since film is a representative social medium that constitutes gender, we should seriously consider this matter. However, in the film industry, where investors, producers, directors, and
                                    staff are mostly men, movies are made mainly from a male perspective. The violent and sexual gaze toward women is not only in horror genre but also in other genres. But finally, the female audience began to
                                    reject the male gaze on the screen, and movies that rebel against this trend are emerging. As a long-time fan of horror genres, I can see that new horror movies are starting to appear. Theaters are slowly being
                                    filled with new types of horror films that have never been seen before. The best example is <i>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i>(2014). This is the first Iranian vampire western movie, and the Iranian vampire
                                    girl is the main character. The girl only absorbs male blood, and the action is punishment for their sin. The victims of vampires are men who have forced love to women unilaterally, or who have only regarded them
                                    as objects of sexual pleasure. But the movie doesn't just show only her vampire side. The girl, skateboarding around the city and decorating her room with posters and records is an ordinary girl who can easily be
                                    seen around us. This work is distinctly different from the horror movies of the past. It is not only a vampire horror film but also expresses the oppressive Islamic culture and the life of women under its system.
                                    Like this film, we can make such a beautiful horror movie without repeating discrimination and hate. Some argue that exclusion and violence in the horror genre should be regarded as a cinematic device and genre
                                    characteristic for the fun of movies. Some ask why should we discuss ethics in horror movies. However, they cannot be excuses. We demand more in-depth analysis and responsibility from creators beyond simply
                                    pointing out gender equality or misogyny. Surely, the misogyny in the horror movie was very thick. It's been the way it has been. But it is changing. This change is being made by us, by the creators. In other
                                    words, everything depends on the attitude of the artists and creators, and the genre characteristic is made by them.<br>

                                    So what are the positions we should have as creators? I have been talking about movies so far, but this is not just about movies. This applies equally to other art fields. Of course, there is also a disagreement
                                    among artists on this issue. Some claim freedom of expression and they say they can create whatever they want. But I truly believe that we must constantly censor our ego as artists and we should be very careful
                                    about what work we are creating. As I said earlier, considering the impact of media on the public and the way it communicates, we can never claim that we have infinite freedom of expression. We have to be as
                                    critical as possible about ourselves than anyone else. But these people think of themselves as exceptional people. Some of their words are correct. We have the right to express freely what we want. But we have to
                                    consider how the things we create interact with society and how they affect society. We should have a strong sense of responsibility to take out the inner idea and shout at the world. As there is no answer to
                                    this problem, individual artists‚Äô thoughts are important. There are three things I learned and would like to propose through this research. First of all, we should think not only about people who are inside the
                                    system but also about people who are outside the system, hidden in the shadows. We can not ignore those who are clearly present in our society. Second, we should not advocate for flattery of the socially
                                    power-bearing side and violence against the socially weak. Lastly, deal with various images of various members of society as much as possible and make things cannot be ignored even if they are uncomfortable.
